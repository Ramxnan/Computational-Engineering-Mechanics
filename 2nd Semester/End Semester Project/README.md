# Computational Engineering Mechanics 2 EndSemester Project

## Course Project Topics: Position Analysis and Animation of Planar Mechanism

Common instructions for Position Analysis and Animation
1. Each team has a unique question. The image in the enclosed project list has URL to the webpage 
with details and animation of the mechanism. 
2. Almost all mechanisms have 6 links and can be mathematically modelled using Line-Line, LineCircle and Circle-Circle intersection methods derived in the class.
3. If the dimensions of the links are not mentioned in the URL, take a screenshot of the animation 
in the URL and paste the image in a CAD software or any image processing software, which 
allows measurement of distance between any two points on the image. Please ensure that when 
you insert the screenshot, the aspect ratio (width: height ratio) is not distorted. The dimensions 
can be in mm or m.
4. Formulate the mechanism on paper. Draw flowchart before you attempt to program in 
MATLAB. A flowchart would have the input information, the steps of processing and the output 
parameters.
5. Formulate and develop MATLAB program to draw the mechanism (position analysis).
6. Animate the mechanism for full rotation of crank link (all mechanisms chosen have a possibility 
of complete rotation of crank/input link).
7. If the URL video/animation has a trace, obtain the trace of corresponding point in MATLAB 
animation. Compare the traces visually.
8. Create a video with the URL animation on the left side and your MATLAB animation on the 
right side. This comparison video is a good souvenir for both students and teachers!
