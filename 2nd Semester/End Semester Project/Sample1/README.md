# Six bar linkage. Inverted slider crank kinematic chain connected in parallel with a four bar linkage -2 (Variant 6)

The mechanism contains a four bar linkage kinematic chain connected in parallel with a slider crank. The kinematic chain RTR´s joints are connected with the coupler and rocker of the four bar linkage. By means of changing the geometrical lengths of the mechanism´s links the coupler point M describe a range of coupler curves.
The basic scheme was generated with the analysis software KOSIM.
The interactive animation was created for the geometrical dimensions: 
l1 = 320 mm, l2 = 100 mm, l3 = 300 mm, l3´ = 100 mm, l4 = 300 mm, l4´ = 450 mm, l5 = 500 mm.
