# Six bar linkage. Inverted slider crank kinematic chain connected in parallel with a four bar linkage -2 (Variant 6)

The mechanism contains a four bar linkage kinematic chain connected in parallel with a slider crank. The kinematic chain RTR´s joints are connected with the coupler and rocker of the four bar linkage. By means of changing the geometrical lengths of the mechanism´s links the coupler point M describe a range of coupler curves.
The basic scheme was generated with the analysis software KOSIM.
The interactive animation was created for the geometrical dimensions: 
l1 = 320 mm, l2 = 100 mm, l3 = 300 mm, l3´ = 100 mm, l4 = 300 mm, l4´ = 450 mm, l5 = 500 mm.


## Code
Language: MATLAB

## Description
1. CircleCircleIntersection.m : Function file to find intersection point of two circles given its center and radius
2. LineCircleIntersection.m   : Function file to find intersection point of a circle and a line given its center and radius of circle & start and end of line
3. SixBarLinkage.mlx          : Function file to excute the question

## Usage
1. The two function files should be in the same folder as the main code file in the same folder
2. Run CircleCircleIntersection.m and LineCircleIntersection.m as MATLAB script file
3. Run SixBarLinkage.mlx as MATLAB live script file
