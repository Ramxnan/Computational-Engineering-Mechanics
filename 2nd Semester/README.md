# Course Objectives
- The course will lay down the basic concepts and techniques of kinetics and kinematics needed for verticals such as robotics.
- It will explore the concepts initially through computational experiments and then try to understand the concepts/theory 
behind it.
- It will help the students to perceive the engineering problems using the fundamental concepts in kinetics and kinematics.
- Another goal of the course is to provide connection between the concepts of mechanics, mathematics and computational 
thinking.
