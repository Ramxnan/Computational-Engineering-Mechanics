# Computational Engineering Mechanics 

Course Objectives
- The course will lay down the basic concepts and techniques of engineering mechanics needed 
for verticals such as robotics.
- It will explore the concepts initially through computational experiments and then try to 
understand the concepts/theory behind it.
- It will help the students to perceive the engineering problems using the fundamental concepts 
in mechanics.
- Another goal of the course is to provide connection between the concepts of mechanics, 
mathematics and computational thinking
